# Merkle tree based whitelist

Simple exmaple of how a merkle tree can be used for whitelisting purposes. Merkle trees can be used to verify large amounts of data, if needed, making it much 
more efficient in terms of cost of user restriction. Merkle trees make it possible to allocate allowance to thousands, even hundreds of thousands or millions 
of users using a simple bytes32 value passed to a smart contract.

# Installation and Usage
